1. Linux offers multiple help systems because they serve different contexts:

man: Opens the manual page for a command. It's comprehensive and standardized, but not all commands have man pages.

--help: Displays a quick summary of options for most commands. It’s faster than man, but less detailed.

help: Only works with shell built-in commands (like cd, echo, export). It’s specific to the shell (e.g., Bash), not external programs.

* Scenario where help is the only correct choice: If you're trying to understand a built-in command like alias or read, man and --help won’t work—only help will give you the right info.
